Experiment: when does the fingerprint see a square factor?

Theorem (notes, Thm 5.3): P_c(p^e, k) = P_c(p, k) whenever f_c^k(x) - x is
separable mod p, i.e. unless some cycle of length l | k has multiplier
lambda = prod 2x_i with lambda^(k/l) = 1 (mod p).  Hence the first depth at
which p^2 differs from p is (for p > 2^k + 1)

    T_c(p) = min over non-critical cycles of  l * ord_p(lambda).

(a) verify the prediction against brute force on Z/p^2 for small p;
(b) distribution of T_c(p): prediction T_c(p) >= p^(1/2 - o(1)) for almost all p.
